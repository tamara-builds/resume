### About

I’m the kind of person who lights up when something breaks, because it’s an opportunity to learn and figure out how to fix something new. Before I started coding, I worked around the world in roles that taught me to listen closely, adapt quickly, and think in systems. I managed finance at Merrill Lynch, supported leprosy-affected communities in India, and taught science in Mexico and China. Now I build backend systems and data pipelines in Python, TypeScript, and Ruby, contribute to civic tech projects, and create APIs that turn messy data into clean, usable formats.

### Highlighted Projects

#### govbot (Windy Civi Toolkit)

**Python | GitHub Actions | Docker | JSON | ETL | Structured Logging | Data Validation**

Open source civic data tooling that addresses a core infrastructure problem: legislative data is fragmented, difficult to track over time, and often dependent on centralized platforms that may be shut down or abandoned.

* Built automated pipelines transforming federal and state legislative data into standardized, append only JSON artifacts for long term analysis and reuse.
* Designed reproducible workflows using timestamped outputs and structured logs so datasets can be independently cloned, verified, and queried.
* Standardized ETL patterns across jurisdictions and legislative sessions, reducing duplicated effort for civic groups, researchers, and educators.
* Implemented Dockerized runs and scheduled GitHub Actions to support repeatable data updates and transparent execution.

#### SciScope

**Node.js | Express | PostgreSQL | Redis | JWT | Caching | Jest | CI/CD**

A RESTful API for science news aggregation with authentication, caching, and analytics.

* Built modular API with external news integration and layered caching.
* Designed PostgreSQL schema and wrote advanced queries for pagination and analytics.
* Automated testing and CI workflows using Jest and GitHub Actions.

#### Adventure Life REST API

**Node.js | TypeScript | Express | PostgreSQL | Knex | Objection.js | Swagger**

Refactored a legacy API into a clean, testable TypeScript backend.

* Modeled complex relational data with Objection.js and PostgreSQL.
* Built modular async workflows and documented endpoints with Swagger.
* Wrote a comprehensive Jest test suite to support long term maintainability.
